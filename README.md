#Intro to Robotics Sampling Based Motion Planning:

## Sampling-based Motion Planning for a Rigid Body in SE(3):

Compute a collision-free path for a rigid body (a piano) among static obstacles (a room) by implementing the Probabilistic Roadmap Method (PRM) as well as its asymptotically optimal variant(PRMâˆ—)  and  evaluating  their  performance  in  terms  of  computational  efficiency  and  path  quality.


## Sampling-based Motion Planning for a Physically Simulated System

Compute feasible controls for a car-like vehicle that result in a collision-free trajectory in a maze-like environment by implementing the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm as well as variants and evaluating their performance in terms of computational efficiency and path quality.  The dynamics of the car-like vehicle can be accessed only through the physics engine.
